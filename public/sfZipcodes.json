(“Compass”) are pleased to offer the opportunity to acquire a unique, non-rent-controlled multifamily portfolio in Downtown San Francisco, California. 780 Van Ness Avenue and 755 Eddy Street (“Properties” or “Subject”) comprise a 0.45-acre site and are being offered together. The Properties were both developed by current ownership, in 1990 and 2003 respectively, and have been well maintained and operated ever since. As such, the Properties represent a high-quality opportunity for an investor to acquire well-located, stabilized assets in a core San Francisco neighborhood that also offer substantial redevelopment potential. Such redevelopment potential stems in part from the fact the land is not fully developed because the site includes a surface parking lot.780 Van Ness Avenue is a four-story mixed-use building occupying a 0.34-acre parcel with 18 two-bedroom/two-bathroom rental apartments above two ground-floor commercial spaces. In addition to the mixed-use building, this parcel is improved with a surface parking lot. 755 Eddy Street is a five-story residential building occupying a 0.11-acre parcel with a total of 12 rental apartments, consisting of 8 one-bedroom/one-bathroom units and 4 two-bedroom/ two-bathroom units. The Properties are situated adjacent to one another in the northwest corner of the block bounded by Van Ness Avenue, Turk Street, Polk Street, and Eddy Street.The Subject site is located three blocks north of San Francisco City Hall and is surrounded by a wide array of uses including medium-density mid-rise residential, high-rise residential, ground-floor retail, and two-story commercial buildings. The mixed-use 30 Van Ness Avenue project from developer Lendlease, which will create 333 condominiums and nearly a quarter million square feet of commercial office space, is only a half-mile walk from the Properties. This project is set to be among the tallest buildings in the Bay Area and one of the few high- rises expected to rise this year in San Francisco."

Ten traction elevators serve the low-rise and high-rise towers, including one freight elevator. There is a sidewalk hydraulic elevator for large deliveries, scheduled in advance. The HVAC system consists of a constant volume system, served by air handling units with chilled water fan coils. There are two environmentally compliant Carrier chillers and two cooling towers.

The elegantly designed tower is angled on opposite corners, with stepped-back usable terraces on four of its upper floors linked with round forms rising to mirror the sky. The exterior finish is a reflective glass and aluminum frame curtain wall. Rich Italian marble in light, warm tones dramatized by inlaid black marble tracery and a fine art sculpture are highlights. The upper floors offer magnificent 360-degree views of San Francisco. Building amenities include: deli/sandwich restaurant, gourmet soup shop, sundry shop, ATM, lounge/fitness center, spectacular views, excellent access to transportation and freeways, dedicated parking, and 24-hour security. In addition to the great tenant amenities, perhaps one of the greatest features of 301 Howard is a rooftop terrace offering breathtaking views of the San Francisco Bay. 301 Howard is situated across from the newly-opened $2.2 billion Salesforce Transit Center that serves as a hub for SF Muni, Golden Gate and AC transit, Greyhound, Amtrak and Caltrain. In addition to Salesforce, neighboring tenants include Google and Facebook which in aggregate lease/own approximately 5 million square feet in close proximity to 301 Howard."

My patience with the staff has been met with apathy. The air gaps in windows and floors have made it impossible to get a good night's sleep, exposing me to cold winds and noise without any signs of improvement. It has become evident that the root of the problem lies not in the building's age but rather in the management's incompetence.During the apartment tour, everything appeared flawless at first glance, but the reality is quite different. The numerous air gaps are just one issue among several. The malfunctioning toilet, combined with misleading information about the premium BOSCH appliances, has been a major source of frustration. Additionally, simple requests, like replacing a broken closet light, took an inexplicable four months and resulted in a cheap, ineffective fixture being installed which is too dim to illuminate a small closet.Whenever the maintenance staff does show up, their efforts are often superficial. When asked what they did to solve the problem, they don’t have an answer and simply shrug. This lack of accountability only adds to the overall dissatisfaction.Regrettably, this luxury rental has provided a subpar experience. Conversations with other tenants have revealed that I am not alone in my dissatisfaction, as several residents have been forced to move out due to unresolved issues.If you're seeking a luxury rental in SF, it would be wise to explore other options that prioritize tenant satisfaction and property maintenance.",

It took management 12 months to approve the portable AC unit and now they are refusing to pay for it. It is usually much warmer. It can be as much as 20 degrees hotter than the outside temperature. It took 6 months for management to address a non-functional stove. They finally replaced it when I informed them that I would do it myself and deduct the cost of the new stove top from my rent. I have requested a rent decrease based on the loft bedroom being so hot that it is unusable and market conditions, which have driven rents down. It is usually much warmer. It can be as much as 20 degrees hotter than the outside temperature. Their response was to invite me to vacate because I complained too much. This was communicated in writing by the owner with no regard of how expensive moving is. I asked if my unit was hot before I leased it. I was told NO."

Built in 1920, the 27,281 SF mixed-use property occupied by a mix of retail, full floor, and private office suites of varied sizes. There is significant opportunity to increase rents and decrease expenses through an aggressive, hands-on management strategy. Improvements to suite interiors and possible suite aggregation at lease expiration paired with a competitive leasing program will afford the eventual purchaser significant growth in rental income. Both listing agents are available to answer questions and set tour times. Please reach out to discuss in detail. 2001 Van Ness’s four stories are comprised of two floors of office over the garage level, all resting atop ground floor retail. The ground floor consists of three retail suites and an elevator lobby which serves the three above-grade floors, garage included. The second-floor garage level is comprised of 22 unobstructed, striped, spaces. To maximize parking, an additional 4 cars can be parked in tandem while still maintaining convenient ingress and egress for all other vehicles. The current ownership employs a garage management company who in turn employs one full-time attendant at the subject property during business hours. Although this allows the garage to hold more cars (±20 visitor vehicles throughout each business day) it does not cover the cost of employing the parking management service and the expense should be removed. Our underwriting omits this expense as well as the associated visitor parking income. More detail on the second-floor parking level is available on pages 18-19. Additional clarity can be provided by the listing agents. The subject property features reinforced masonry construction as well as a reinforced concrete foundation. The property’s roof is flat with a built-up top surface and has an HVAC system with roof-mounted condensers paired with 20-ton air handlers to service split units. The current ownership has completed significant property improvements totaling over $400,000 in the last 24 calendar months. Improvements include but are not limited to exterior painting, coating, sealant, rehabilitation, new roof and substantial roof upgrades, air conditioner replacement and upgrade, elevator hydraulic system repair and upgrade, elevator car repair and upgrade plus cosmetic upgrades, lobby door security upgrades & security camera upgrades, garage door repairs, and other assorted improvements and repairs. In addition, the property will benefit directly from the in-progress Van Ness Improvement Project. This substantial civic improvement will deliver San Francisco its first Bus Rapid Transit system, a globally proven solution to improve transit service on bustling urban arterials. To maximize the community benefit, the project includes extensive utility maintenance, safety enhancements, and other civic improvements along the corridor such as wider, better lit pedestrian walkways that should help revitalize the historic corridor and encourage additional foot traffic. This investment opportunity offers a sophisticated investor the chance to increase income and decrease expenses through an aggressive, hands-on management strategy. Improvements to suite interiors and possible suite aggregation at lease expiration, paired with an aggressive leasing program, should afford the eventual purchaser significant growth in rental income, bringing the average property rents in line with achieved rents in similar quality properties along the Van Ness corridor."
